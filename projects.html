<h2>Real-time Traffic Simulation using Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm</h2>
<b>Description: Build a simulation tool that uses Dijkstra's algorithm to 
calculate the shortest path between multiple nodes in a city map. Use it to 
simulate traffic flow and predict the fastest routes in real-time.
Features: Interactive city map, live traffic simulation, route optimization.
Skills Highlighted: Graph Algorithms, C++, Real-time Systems, Simulation.</b>   
<h2>Event Scheduler with Priority Queue</h2>
<p><b>Description: Build a scheduler that prioritizes tasks and events using a 
priority queue. The system should help users schedule their tasks effectively 
based on urgency and importance.
Features: Add, update, and remove events with time and priority settings.
Skills Highlighted: C++, Priority Queues, Time Management Algorithms.
